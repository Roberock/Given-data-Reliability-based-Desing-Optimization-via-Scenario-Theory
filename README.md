# Given-data-Reliability-based-Desing-Optimization-via-Scenario-Theory
A set of methods and proprieties to perform reliability-based-design-optimization by Scenario theory.  Scenario optimization makes direct use of the available data (the uncertain parameters delta)  thereby eliminating the need for estimating the distribution of the uncertain parameters
